## Diversity Issues in Data Analytics

Data Analytics, and STEM domains more broadly, face persistent challenges with diversity.

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
::: {.callout-caution title="**Gender Imbalance**"}
Women continue to be **significantly underrepresented** in STEM programmes and professions due to limited role models, implicit biases, and structural inequities.
:::
:::

::: {#second-column}
::: {.callout-caution title="**Socioeconomic Disparities**"}
Individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are much **less likely to pursue advanced study or careers** in STEM fields.
:::
:::
::::

While many factors explain these issues, some can be directly tackled in class.

## Teaching Data Analytics ...

... Involves guiding learners to **interpret data** effectively and apply it to **informed decision-making**. 

{{< li zllgguxq trigger=loop >}} This requires introducing key concepts such as data collection, cleaning, and transformation, alongside statistical methods and visualisation techniques. 

{{< li zllgguxq trigger=loop >}} The teacher’s role extends beyond demonstrating tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, or Tableau but to help students understand when and why to use them.

## Teaching Data Analytics

Building **trust and confidence in the technologies** is essential to ensure students remain engaged.

<br>

To increase learner adoption of the taught technologies:

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} They need to see the output before using the tool;

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} They should be able to obtain first results quickly;

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} It is important to limit initial verbose and issues at set up.

## Technology Acceptance Model {background="#43464B"}

This matches with past research initiated by Fred Davis and collaborators in 1989.

## Software vs. Diversity

Locally installed software often **creates barriers** to learner adoption:

:::: {layout="[1.1,0.9]"}
::: {#first-column}
- Learners must first master basic operations;
- It takes time and expertise before having a convincing output;
- Installation is often lengthy and cumbersome, particularly on older or entry-level computers.

## Software for Diversity

Cloud-based software mirrors traditional on-premise versions but is **hosted on remote servers and accessed through a web browser**:

{{< li qawxkplz trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} They eliminate installation requirements and are ready for immediate use;

{{< li qawxkplz trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} They are independent of the user’s local computing power;

{{< li qawxkplz trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} Final outputs published by other users can be accessed freely.

# Case Study 1: <br> Teaching Tableau

## Data Visualisation Dashboards

Tableau (Salesforce) is a **platform for creating interactive data visualisation dashboards**, comparable to Power BI (Microsoft) and Looker Studio (Alphabet). 

It was widely used to present COVID-19 data globally.

:::: {layout="[1,2]"}
::: {#first-column}
![](https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2022-07/Tableau%20Public%20homepage.gif)
:::

::: {#second-column}
Originally released as licensed on-premise software, Tableau also offers an **open-access cloud version called Tableau Public** which has now 5 million of users account created and 11 million of dashboards available online.

## Tableau Public

{{< li yucrjnnl trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} Students can assess what is possible as well as getting inspired.

{{< li yucrjnnl trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} Free to use, students can immediately login and deep dive in the software.

{{< li yucrjnnl trigger=loop delay=3000 >}} The only way to save is by publishing online. It makes them accountable and egger to perform.

<br>

Using these advantages, EDHEC Business School in France and UNICEF, in partnership with Tableau, have launched the **Student Data Viz Challenge**.

## The Student Data Viz Challenge

Created in 2020, the challenge is open to all students in Europe to design the best dashboards using data from the UNICEF organisation.

**Integrating the Challenge's instructions as an assignment in my Data Analytics and Storytelling course**, then leaving the opportunity for the students to participate to the actual challenge if they want to.

Since 2020, DCU students have consistently featured in the Top 10! **The highlight came in 2024 when 5 DCU students were placed in the Top 10 including winner and runner-up! {{< fa trophy >}}**

> "**After being introduced to Tableau through one of her courses, Federica became immediately captivated** by the tool and the ability to transform data into compelling stories. **While creating her first dashboard, she felt Tableau was a hidden talent she had just discovered** which inspired her to enroll in the EDHC Student Dataviz Challenge. **She aimed to create something new and learn along the way but was met with victory**. Federica’s goal is to prioritize crafting a clear and engaging narrative over simply explaining the data tables and their construction." <https://www.tableau.com/blog/datafam-roundup-july-8-12-2024>

# Case Study 2: <br> Teaching {{< fa brands python >}} and {{< fa brands r-project >}}

## Coding for Data Reporting

While the first steps into coding are slow and tedious, **using cloud-based solutions to bypass the frustrating stage of software installation is essential**.

## Google Colab to Teach Python

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} Google Colab is a cloud solution giving access for free to Jupyter Notebooks (interface to run Python Code).

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} Initially released in 2017, it is now wildly adopted because it allows user to start coding without installing the language and regardless of their systems' characteristics.

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} For Business Students in Master's, it offers a ideal platform to start learning without running into difficulties. When adding GenAI "vibe coding" solutions, all students can expend their skills very quickly.

## Posit Cloud to Teach R

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} Posit Cloud is a freemium service providing an online environment with the R coding language and the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} While the platform only offers 20h/month free for each student, it is enough to introduce the language and the IDE.

{{< li umuwriak trigger=loop >}} PhD Students from all disciplines thrive in this online coding environment. They can immediately start to investigate their data and obtain results.

## Going Forward {{< fa forward >}} {background="#43464B"}

Supporting under represented groups starts by **adapting the way we teach**.

Tools are not neutral. Licensed and **on-premise software are not only intrusive but also generating inequalities** due to their initial complexity.

Teaching Data Analytics with cloud-based software, helps to **highlight the Ease-of-use and the Usefulness of the tools** which are used as leverage to promote learners success.

If curious about my method, all slides are available online here: <https://damien-dupre.github.io/courses/>
