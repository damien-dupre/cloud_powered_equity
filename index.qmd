## Diversity Issues in Data Analytics

Data Analytics, and STEM domains more broadly, have a long-standing issue with diversity

::: {.callout-caution title="**Gender Imbalance**"}
Women remain significantly under-represented in STEM programmes and professions.
:::

::: {.callout-caution title="**Socioeconomic Disparities**"}
Individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are far less likely to pursue advanced study or careers in STEM fields.
:::

While many factors explains these issues, some can be directly tackled in class.

## Teaching Data Analytics

Teaching learners to make sense of data and use it for informed decision-making. 

It involves introducing key concepts: data collection, cleaning, and transformation, alongside statistical methods and visualisation techniques. 

The role of a teacher is not only to explain tools like Excel, SQL, Python, or Tableau but to help students understand when and why to use them.

## Teaching Data Analytics

Building trust and confidence is key to ensure that students are on board.

To increase learners adoption or willingness to adopt:

- Need to see the output before using the tool
- Need to obtain first results quickly
- Need to limit initial verbose and issues at set up

## Technology Acceptance Model

This matches with past research initiated by Fred Davis in 1989.

## Software vs. Diversity

On-premise software (i.e., installed on local computers) are barriers to facilitate learners adoption

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
- Basic operations are learnt first
- It takes time and expertise before having a convincing output
- Installing them is usually long and fastidious, especially on older/entry level computers
:::

## Software for Diversity

Cloud-based software are usually the same as on-premise software versions but hosted on a remote computer (i.e., server) and accessible with a web browser.

- They remove the installation step, can be used immediately
- They are not dependent on the user's computer processing power
- Final output published by other users can be access freely

# Case Study 1: <br> Teaching Tableau

## Data Visualisation Dashboards

Tableau (Salesforce) is a software to build interactive data visualisation dashboards like PoweBI (Microsoft) and Looker Studio (Alphabet). 

Particularly used to display COVID-19 data across the world.

Tableau has first been developed as a licensed on-premise software but also has an open access cloud version called "Tableau Public"

![](https://public.tableau.com/app/assets/images/tableau-public-logo-with-padding.png)

## Tableau Public

5 million of users account created and 11 million of dashboards available online. Students can assess what is possible as well as getting inspired.

![](https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2022-09/Past-Viz-of-the-Day.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Free to use, students can immediately login and deep dive in the software.

The only way to save is by publishing online. It makes them accountable and egger to perform.

## The Student Data Viz Challenge

Organised by the EDHEC Business School (France), UNICEF, and Tableau since 2021. Open to all students in Europe, their dashboard has to use some of the UNICEF organisation data to compete.

### The Idea {{< fa lightbulb >}}

**Integrating the Challenge's instructions as an assignment in my Data Analytics and Storytelling course**, then leaving the opportunity for the students to participate to the actual challenge if they want to.

### The Results {{< fa square-poll-vertical >}}

Since 2021, DCU students have consistently featured in the Top 10! **The apex was in 2024 when 5 DCU students were placed in the top 10 including winner and runner-up! {{< fa trophy >}}**

> "**After being introduced to Tableau through one of her courses, Federica became immediately captivated** by the tool and the ability to transform data into compelling stories. **While creating her first dashboard, she felt Tableau was a hidden talent she had just discovered** which inspired her to enroll in the EDHC Student Dataviz Challenge. **She aimed to create something new and learn along the way but was met with victory**. Federica’s goal is to prioritize crafting a clear and engaging narrative over simply explaining the data tables and their construction." <https://www.tableau.com/blog/datafam-roundup-july-8-12-2024>

# Case Study 2: <br> Teaching {{< fa brands python >}} and {{< fa brands r-project >}}

## Coding for Data Reporting

While the first steps into coding are slow and tedious, using cloud based solutions to skip the critical moment of software installation is crucial.

## Google Colab to Teach Python

Google Colab is a cloud solution giving access for free to Jupyter Notebooks (interface to run Python Code).

Initially released in 2017, it is now wildly adopted because it allows user to start coding without installing the language and regardless of their systems' characteristics.

### The Results {{< fa square-poll-vertical >}}

For Business Students in Master's, it offers a ideal platform to start learning without running into difficulties. When adding GenAI "vibe coding" solutions, all students can expend their skills very quickly.

## Posit Cloud to Teach R

Posit Cloud is a freemium service providing an online environment with the R coding language and the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

While the platform only offers 20h/month free for each student, it is enough to introduce the language and the IDE.

### The Results {{< fa square-poll-vertical >}}

PhD. Students from all disciplines thrive in this online coding environment. They can immediately start to investigate their data and obtain results.

## Going Forward {{< fa forward >}}

Supporting under represented groups starts by adapting the way we teach.

Tools are not neutral. Licensed and on-premise software are not only intrusive but also generating inequalities due to their initial complexity.

Teaching Data Analytics with cloud-based software, helps to highlight the Ease-of-use and the Usefulness of the tools which are used as leverage to promote learners success.
